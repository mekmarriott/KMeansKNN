3. Yes, patient #35 with ALL seems to be consistently classified as an AML patient across many k values.

4. Using p=0.5 and after running the program 5 times for each k = 5,10,20,30, there were only three false negatives (i.e. an ALL patient misclassified as a AML patient) total: patient 21, 27 (k=10), and patient 33 (k=20).

6. The clustering sensitivity starts at 1.0 and decreases to around 0.5 as p increases. The clustering specificity follows the opposite trend, starting close to 0 (0.04) as p increases and reaching 1 at large p-values. Intuitively, having a low threshold (p-value) for labelling positives will increase false positives and decrease false negatives, which decreases specificity and increases sensitivity. Conversely, having a high threshold for labelling positives will decrease false positives and increase false negatives, which increases specificity and decreases sensitivity.
Clustering accuracy increases as p increases, peaks around p=0.5, and then decreases as p approaches 1 (illustrated by extra_output/p_vs_accuracy.jpg). This trend accurately reflects the aforementioned tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.
